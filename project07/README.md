# Project 7: DB+GitHub Chaining

This project demonstrates how to chain two tools together: one that fetches data from a database and another that uses that data to create a GitHub issue.

## How to run

1.  Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `YOUR_USERNAME`, and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` in `client.py` with your actual GitHub token, username, and repository name.
2.  Start the server: `python server.py`
3.  In a separate terminal, run the client: `python client.py`

## Expected Output

```
Issue created successfully!
```
