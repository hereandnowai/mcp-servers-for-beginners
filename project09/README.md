# Project 9: Custom Secure Server

This project demonstrates how to create a more secure MCP server with input sanitization and a basic authentication mechanism.

## How to run

1.  Start the server: `python server.py`
2.  In a separate terminal, run the client: `python client.py`

## Expected Output

```
Sanitized message: Hello This is a test with some special characters 
Authenticated and processed data: This is some sensitive data.
Error: Authentication failed.
```
