# Project 2: File Reader Tool

This project demonstrates how to create an MCP server with a tool to read files from the local file system.

## How to run

1.  Make sure you have a `sample.txt` file in the same directory as the client.
2.  Start the server: `python server.py`
3.  In a separate terminal, run the client: `python client.py`

## Expected Output

```
This is a sample file for the file reader tool.
```
